# Task
Given a list of N distinct integers A[i] representing the in-order traversal of
some Binary Search Tree (BST), find the post-order traversal of any such BST of
the minimum height.

# Input
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two lines. First line contains N. Second line
contains the integers A[i].

# Output
For each test in the given order, print any valid order of the integers which
you are asked to find in this task in one separate line.

# Time limit
1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

# Hints
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N*log(N)) solution is expected.
