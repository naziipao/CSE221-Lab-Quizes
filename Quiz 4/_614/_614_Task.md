# Task
Given an unweighted unrooted tree with N nodes, find the longest possible
distance between any pair of nodes (and any such pair of nodes).
The nodes are numbered from 1 to N.

# Input
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by N lines. First line contains N. Each of the next
(N-1) lines contains U[i] and V[i] indicating that there is an edge between
U[i] and V[i].

# Output
For each test in the given order, print two lines. In the first line print the
largest possible distance and in the second line print two node numbers between
which the distance is the largest.

# Time limit
1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

# Hints
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N) solution is expected.
