# Task
Given the initial position (X, Y) in an N by N chessboard, find how many
distinct cells are reachable from the initial position within K Knight moves.
The rows and columns are numbered from 1 to N.

# Input
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by four integers N, K, X, Y in one line.

# Output
For each test in the given order, print the number of distinct reachable cells
which you are asked to find in this task in one line.

# Time limit
1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

# Hints
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
