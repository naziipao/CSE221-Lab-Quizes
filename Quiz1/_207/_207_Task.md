# Task
Given a list of N integers A[i], and another list of M integers B[i], and
another list of L integers C[i], all three sorted in non-decreasing order,
find the K'th smallest integer among all the N+M+L integers.

# Input
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by four lines. First line contains N, M, L and K.
Second line contains the integers A[i]. Third line contains the integers B[i].
Forth line contains the integers C[i].

# Output
For each test in the given order, print one integer in one line, the answer you
are asked in this task.

# Time limit
1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

# Hints
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N+M+L) solution is expected.
